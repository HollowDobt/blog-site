## 原文版

I have just returned from a visit to my landlord - the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.

I have just returned from a visit to my `landlord`(房东) - the `solitary`(孤独, 独居) neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have `fixed on`(找到) a `situation`(位置) so completely `removed from`(远离, 将...与...分离) the `stir`(纷扰) of society. A perfect `misanthropist's`(厌世者的) heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to `divide`(分享) the `desolation`(荒凉) between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I `beheld`(瞅着, 看着; behold) his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.
